# Job Search Magic
Extract job listing from a web page, and provide AI generated keywords to tailor a customized resume. Because time is our most valuable resource. Let's automate the hell out of the boring stuff!

## What it does
This script automates some of the job searching process by scraping the job description from the job posting website, analyzing the posting for keywords, and creating a folder to keep job application materials organized. YAKE is used behind the scenes to generate keywords from the job posting, and Beautiful soup is used to scrape the web page.
